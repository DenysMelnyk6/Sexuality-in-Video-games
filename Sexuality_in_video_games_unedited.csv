Sometimes character over-sexualization can be justified as a game selling point (a lot of fighting video game franchises from Dead or Alive to Mortal Kombat), or as means of making sense (The Witcher series with its rather... independent female magicians, or Morrigan from Dragon Age, whose image was specifically designed around the idea of breaking rules of a more civilized society).

So, a game that doesn't really talk about sexuality much is fine, a game that heavily involves sexuality is fine, but I'm generally annoyed by something that has a lot of sexualized character designs but doesn't have anything in particular to do with that and it doesn't connect to the game's overall purpose or its setting.
Also, for LGBT characters, I'd note that while there doesn't have to be any sort of ""logical explanation"" (this is an absurd thing to say when we already exist and no justification is needed for cis straight people to be in a story), it is important for them to not be overly stereotyped or fetishized. I would also not say that I am ""okay with"" LGBT characters, but instead that I actively prefer them. For anything focused on romance or sexuality, it's necessary to me to have options reflecting my gender and sexuality for me to pursue that part of the game, and even in other games I enjoy seeing greater diversity.
For the 'explained logically' bit, I would add that I find it more common for games with an absence of LGBT characters or options reflecting those characters to be missing a logical explanation. You have some expansive open world and everyone in it is cis and straight? No. That wouldn't happen, and nobody benefits by pretending it would.
Fourth, it should also be noted that the presence of LGBT characters does not indicate a game has sexual themes any more than a straight romance that doesn't show sexual content would."

Some stories are meant to tackle subjects like sexuality, and while it is obviously a mature topic, it has all rights to exist. 
Some designs however exist solely for basic titillation and as a crutch for not giving the characters actual personalities, only trying to show their ''assets'' at every opprtunity. Those I usually can't stand and would definitely call examples of oversexualized characters."
