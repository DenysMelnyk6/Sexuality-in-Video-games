This project is supposed to complement an essay written by a Computer Game Design And Graphics student at EKA University of Applied Sciences.
To write the essay, a survey was taken, collecting 247 answers by the time the code was written.
The survey was made by a student who had no experience with statistics or surveys prior,
with no data analysis in mind, so some of it was not used and/or was not relavent to the topic.
Raw data of a survey can be found in Sexuality_analysis_unedited.csv.
The survey was conducted via Google Forms, opportunity sampling was chosen as a strategy to spread the survey.


The rating from 1 to 7 showed to be inefficient for this type of work, as some box plots showed how inconsistent data is -
Sometimes mean value and upper and/or lower quartile were the same value, showing most other values as outliers.
As no target was set at the beginning of the project, initially the data was processed and sorted.
Later on the objective was set to show the statistical data(mean, median, standart deviation, minimal and maximum values) of 
different groups surveyed. The groups were split by: Gender, Age Groups, Country, Sexual Orientation and Prefered Game Genre.

Certain statistical data from the survey is increadibly abstract, hardly reflecting any meaningful data, yet it was still used for
the essay.
